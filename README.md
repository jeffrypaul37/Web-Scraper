# Introduction
             This project has been done with a view to help job-seekers find jobs at their nearest locations easily.
# Implementation
             The technique used in the implementation of this project is called “web-scraping”. Using web-scraping, we can access the contents of any webpage and display it in a format that we like.
             Here, the job details from a popular jobsite have been scraped using Python and the necessary libraries such as beautifulsoup, openpyxl and requests. These details have then been automatically arranged in an Excel spreadsheet, without any manual entry. Hence, instead of scrolling through several lists of jobs, the details of each job are made in a more readable format through the spreadsheet. Each job can be compared easily. It is also possible to apply for the desired job directly by clicking the apply link provided in the spreadsheet. Whenever the webpage gets updated, we get a new spreadsheet with the updated data. Hence, the data accessed is always up to date.
      Finally, this spreadsheet is imported to Google Maps and the exact location of each company listed is mapped. This helps users locate the company easily and also gives a view of the overall concentration of jobs in and around his/her current location. 
      
      

      This project can be further developed to scrape multiple websites which will enable future job-seekers to find their desired job within a short period of time, without the burden of having to access several websites and looking up each job separately.
